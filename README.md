# meme_warfare

Started compiling official HRC campaign assets into this github repo for centralized, easy access and collaboration. Over the next 36 hours we need to deploy highly effective memes. The more realistic they appear, the more effective they become.

In this repo right now I have the official HRC font "SharpUnity" in all of its flavors, official HRC logos in various color/opacity combos, official HRC facebook share images (which are very easy to use as meme templates) as well as various images pulled directly from her campaign website. I'll be updating this soon with an official styleguide based on her own assets.
